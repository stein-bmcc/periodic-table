periodic-table
==============

Periodic table of HTML elements.

Note: the original code uses a highlighter that is no longer available (http://syntaxhighlight.in). This site had a tool to convert code into highlighted markup.

Am now experimenting with highlight.js to see if that can replace it (https://highlightjs.org, https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js). That doesn't include the feature to show just the text, but it does have line number that aren't selected if you select the code to copy.
